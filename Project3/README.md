The assignment focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning for image classification.

The assignment is divided into two main parts:

Building a CNN from Scratch

Implement a custom CNN using PyTorch.
Train and evaluate the model on the Animals-10 Dataset.
Optimize hyperparameters and analyze performance.
Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models

Utilize ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2 from torchvision.
Fine-tune models with different strategies:
Feature extraction (freezing all layers except the last).
Fine-tuning specific layers.
Fine-tuning the entire model.
Compare performance with the custom CNN in terms of accuracy, training time, and efficiency.
